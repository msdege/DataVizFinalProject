											<h2>Project Overview</h2>
										</header>
										<p>Substance use disorders have affected humanity throughout our existence. For most of written history, there exists anecdotal evidence of drug use. Nowadays, drug use is common, and addiction to certain drugs is a relevant issue. With rapid changes in society and technology, I wonder how drug use has also changed. What I seek to understand are the drug-related trends that may occur over a short period. For my project, I am examining the rates of illicit substance dependence in the U.S. from 2011 to 2019 (excluding 2015). I am looking only at adults aged 18 or older. The question I am researching is, “How have illicit substance addiction rates in the U.S. changed in the past 10 years?” Answering these questions may provide insight into the larger national trends of drug use which could be supplemented by deeper research into the reasons why drugs may be used.
										<br /><br />
										SAMHSA, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration conducts a National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) in which participants from around the United States indicate their afflictions with mental or substance use disorders. One survey they conduct is based on illicit substance dependence. Illicit substance dependence is defined as "the misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics (not as directed by a doctor) or the use of marijuana, cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or methamphetamine."
										<br /><br />
										I focus on the data collected from each state within the U.S. I hope this will show national trends as well as regional trends within clusters of states. For each state and each year, a percentage of the people dependent on illicit substances is shown. The percentage is calculated by dividing the current number of people dependent by the total state population for each year.

								<p class="content">To examine individual states and their data values for a given year, hover over each one. A tooltip will pop up which contains the relevant information. The information I have chosen to show is <strong>State, Year, Total People Dependent, Percentage of Population, Change From Previous Year,</strong> and <strong>Change From 2011</strong>. <strong>Change From Previous Year</strong> and <strong>Change From 2011</strong> refer to the change in the percentage of the population, not the total number of people dependent. You can click on a state and select it so that it is highlighted. You can also zoom and pan on the map of the contiguous U.S., not the map of Alaska or Hawaii. To view the different years, go to the <strong>Year</strong> menu and cycle through the years with the arrows or select the year from the dropdown menu.

                                    When a state is selected, the  <strong>Percentages Over Time</strong> point chart in the bottom right corner is updated. It will show the percentages over all of the available years for the selected state. This allows the reader to see the trends over time without cycling through each year on the map.

									<h2>Analysis</h2>
									<p>Main Takeaway: Illicit drug dependence increased from 2011 to 2019, by a lot!</p>
								</header>
								<p class="content">Across every single state, drug dependence increased. Why? There could be a plethora of factors that influence the reliance rate on illicit drugs. Economic, social, and even spiritual factors could be at play here. Perhaps everyone in the U.S. has gotten significantly more stressed in the past few years. It is hard to tell, and a deeper analysis would need to be conducted to uncover the truth. On the state level, The largest increase from 2011 to 2019 was in the state of Colorado with an increase of <strong>200%</strong>! Why is this? Well, Colorado is known for its *cough* ahem *cough* cannabis legality, so marijuana may be a large contributor to the overall percentage. Bear in mind that legality in terms of this project is determined at the federal level, not the state level, and marijuana is still federally illegal. The smallest increase was 35.3% in Tennessee followed closely by West Virginia with 35.8%. This is surprising to me because I know that West Virginia and Tennessee have struggled with drug problems, mainly in rural Appalachia. So, perhaps the usage has always been high, and there hasn't been too much of a substantial increase in recent years. <br /> <br />
									In 2019, regionally, there seems to be a greater dependent percentage of the population on the West Coast and the Northeast. Within the Midwest and the Southeast, dependence is relatively less. Is there a correlation between these locations and their political affiliation? Well, both the Northeast and the West Coast are more liberal and progressive with their drug policies, so perhaps there is a positive relationship between drugs legalized at the state level and their usage within those states. Usage, however, does not necessarily constitute dependence, and many of the "illicit substances" in the dataset are illegal both federally and in every state still. So, I would not say this is a hard and fast conclusion.<br /> <br />
									<strong>Why is 2015 not shown?</strong> There are relatively large jumps in dependence rates from 2014 to 2016 for most of the states, so the 2015 data may help us understand this trend. Unfortunately, there is no Illicit Substance Dependence data from SAMHSA for this year. In fact, for 2015, their data set excluded many other variables that were accounted for in earlier and later years. Why is this? I have no idea. There is no explanation on SAMHSA's website or in the 2015 data sets. I noticed that the 2015 data did not get published until 2017 along with the 2016 data, so perhaps some internal company issues prevented them from collecting all the data they usually do and subsequently publishing it on time. That is just my best guess, however.

									<h2>Conclusion</h2>
									<p>
										In conclusion, this data visualization project has shed light on the changes in drug dependence in the United States from 2011 to 2019. Through the careful analysis and visualization of relevant data, we have gained valuable insights into the evolving patterns and trends surrounding drug dependency.
										
										From the visualizations, several noteworthy observations have emerged. We have observed significant regional variations in drug dependence rates, uncovering hotspots where certain substances are more prevalent.
										
										As with any data visualization project, it is essential to acknowledge the limitations and potential biases in the data used. I have strived for accuracy and transparency, but there could always be limiting factors. The biggest one here may be the time frame in which I am looking. There could be completely different trends present if we included data from before and after the specified time frame.

										Overall, I hope my data visualization project has contributed to raising awareness about the scale of the drug dependence problem. By presenting the data in a visually appealing and accessible manner, I hope to encourage readers and researchers to delve deeper into the underlying causes, consequences, and potential solutions to combat drug dependence effectively. This would help create a healthier society.

								<!-- <p class="content">Across every single state, drug dependence increased. The largest increase from 2011 to 2019 was in the state of Colorado with an increase of <strong>238%</strong>! The smallest increase was 31% in West Vriginia. This is sruprising to me because I know that West Virginia has struggled with drug problems. So, perhaps the usage has always been high, and there hasn't been too much of a substantial increase in recent years.
								Regionally, there seems to be a large increase in the East compared to the West. In both the Northeast and Southeast, states states substantially increased their drug dependence.</p> -->
